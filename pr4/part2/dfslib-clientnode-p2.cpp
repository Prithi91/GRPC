    // the current file storage

    // If the write lock request fails, you should return a status of RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED

    // to write or fetch over top of each other. So, you'll need to determine
    // what type of locking/guarding is necessary to ensure the threads are

    // concurrent actions between the inotify watcher and the
    // server cache checks in the SyncTimerCallback to prevent a race condition.

    // the synchronization timer when a file event has been signaled?
