# GRPC

This project implements a simple distributed file system (DFS). Several file transfer protocols have been developed using gRPC and Protocol Buffers.A weakly consistent synchronization system has been incorporated to manage cache consistency between multiple clients and a single server. The system handles both binary and text-based files.

The source code uses a combination of C++14, gRPC, and Protocol Buffers.
